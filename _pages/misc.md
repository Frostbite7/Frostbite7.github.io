I run marathons and am a routine long-distance runner. My personal best is 3:32:00 at 2019 Illinois Marathon.

I am of ethnic Miao/Hmong descent and grew up in the mountainous areas of Southwestern China. I went to Beijing for my undergraduate study
and later came to the U.S. for graduate school. I would love to get to know people with similar background.
