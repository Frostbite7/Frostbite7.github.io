I am an amateur astrophotographer. Check out my work on [500px](https://500px.com/p/yangyicge?view=photos).

I run marathons and am a routine long-distance runner. My personal best is 3:32:00 at the 2019 Champaign Marathon.

I am of ethnic Miao/Hmong descent and grew up in the mountainous areas of southwestern China. I went to Beijing for my undergraduate study
and later came to the U.S. for graduate school. I would love to get to know people with similar background.
