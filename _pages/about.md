## About me

I am a computational modeler currently completing my PhD at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My PhD focuses on
ecological-hydrological modeling (esp., plant response
to drought), fine-scale soil moisture dynamics, and model-data integration for earth and climate science. Before that, I received my B.S. in
Hydraulic engineering and a second B.S. in economics from Tsinghua University, China. I'm looking for full-time positions in both industry
and academia starting from Spring/Summer 2024.

## Education

Aug., 2018 - Jan. 2024 (expected)\
**Ph.D. in Earth System Science**\
College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences\
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\
Advisor: [Dr. Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/)

**B.S. in Hydraulic Engineering**\
Department of Hydraulic Engineering\
Tsinghua University\

**B.S. in Economics**\
School of Economics and Management\
Tsinghua University\

## Research Interest

My research interest is using combined physical (process-based) and statistical (machine learning) models to simulate complex systems, with
a focus currently on earth and climate science. Especially, how complex physical models can be simplified for increased efficiency in
estimation and prediction, how to quantify and improve the robustness and trustworthiness of inferred process understanding from model data
fusion given the scarcity and uncertainty of observation data (a ubiquitous issue in earth and climate science), and how process-based and
machine learning based models can be combined to reliably and efficiently simulate complex systems constrained by observation data of
varying uncertainties.
